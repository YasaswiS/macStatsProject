<h1> Conclusion </h1>

<p class = "ex2"> After sampling our population of Del Norte students, we calculated the proportion of Mac users which came out to 0.3182. This was much higher than the proportion of Mac users in the world as a whole, which was 0.1584. After creating a sampling distribution to calculate the probability of getting a sample proportion of 0.3182 or higher assuming that there was no difference between Del Norte and the world, we found that there was only a 0.02% chance of this occurring. This was much lower than our significance level, giving us strong statistical evidence that there is a difference in the proportions of Mac users at Del Norte and the world.
</p>

<p class = "ex2">However, our study did have a shortcoming in addressing how age could impact the proportion of Mac users in a population. Not controlling for this variable means that our study can’t conclude that the reason why Del Norte students have a higher proportion of Mac users is due to having a higher family income than the world. This is because an individual from our sample population is on average younger than the average person that was sampled from the world, which could be the real reason why there is a higher proportion of Mac users at Del Norte.
</p>

<p class = "ex2">Furthermore, since we only sampled students from Del Norte, we can only generalize our statement to all Del Norte students. We can’t make inferences about populations outside of Del Norte students, even though the underlying reason why Del Norte students have a higher proportion of Mac users can apply to families in the rest of the 4s Ranch area, which could mean that 4s Ranch as a whole has a higher proportion of Mac users.
</p>

<p class="ex2">We weren’t surprised by our findings, as people attending Del Norte tend to be part of wealthier families than the average family worldwide. As a result, they would be more able to afford Mac computers to use as their primary device. Although, we were mildly surprised that there was a statistically significant difference between the two, meaning that there was a large enough difference in the proportion of Mac users at Del Norte and the world, that it is highly unlikely our sample result was that different due to chance alone.
