<h1> Introduction </h1>

<h2> How does income affect how often Apple products are used?
</h2>

<p class = "ex2">Apple products and Macs are known to be more expensive than other laptops that are similar in performance, due to the Apple products being classified as luxury items. This makes non mac laptops like windows laptops more popular to the general public.

</p>

<p class = "ex2">Since Del Norte is located in a part of the country where families tend to have more disposable income than the average family, we wanted to see if more people used Apple products proportionally in Del Norte compared to the country as a whole.

</p>

<p class="ex2">In order to do this, we measured the difference in proportion of Mac users in Del Norte High School, a wealthier neighborhood, and the proportion of Mac users in the country.
</p>

<p class="ex2">We did this by collect cluster samples of Del Norte students by using a numbered list of all Del Norte classrooms and using random.org to choose a random class to sample, ensuring that we get a random sample of students. We made sure our sample has a normal sampling distribution by making sure large counts are met (since we are measuring the proportion of apple/mac users at Del Norte). We plan on doing this by continuing to sample classes till we get 10 successes (apple users) and 10 failures (non apple users), and then surveying a couple extra rooms to reduce sampling variability further. To make sure our sampling method keeps all student's answers independent of each other, we made sure that no one knows the other students' answers and to survey less than 10% of all Del Norte students. A possible confounding variable is families having multiple devices, which may cause the sample to have a higher proportion of mac users. To combat this we plan on asking the operating system of the device the surveyee primarily uses. To reduce bias, we are asking for the operating system by name rather than asking if the surveyee has a mac or non-mac computer and then converting that to mac or non-mac to not provide suggestive vocabulary.
